# I tried to assemble the buckwheat genome using Hifiasm with PacBio HiFi data, Hi-C data and parental data
# I first tried Hifiasm (Hi-C) mode to assemble the genome with PacBio HiFi data and Hi-C data
# Then I tried Hifiasm (Trio) mode to assemble the genome with PacBio HiFi data and parental data
# Both attempts returned a very nice haplotype-resolved assembly with nearly balanced haplotypes
# However, phasing would be more accurate with the parental data, and the assembly from Hifiasm (trio) seems to be more contiguous
# Therefore, we should continue with the assembly generated by Hifiasm (trio) 
# Codes of assembly is in Run_hifiasm.sh
